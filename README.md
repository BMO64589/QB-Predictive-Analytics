# QB-Predictive-Analytics
This predictive code base contains model and hyperparameter search implementations for predicting qb passing yards. These implementations were done using python, sklearn, tensorflow, numpy, pandas and matplotlib.
Initial model testing indicates that predictions are only 31 yards away from ground truth values, on average.

## Installation
